### What did you do this past week?

This past week as usual I went to the lectures for the presentations. On Tuesday groups presented the extra credit lectures. It was interesting hearing listening various other python topics we did not cover in class. On Thrusday half of the groups presented their idb projects including us. It was interesting to see other projects and what other groups struggled with or learned. I think overall our presentation went well for our project. We also presented our extra credit about subprocesses which went well as well. We also got our final grade back for the udb project.  

### What's in your way?

The only thing in my way now is the exam next week. I did not do too well on the last exam so I want to do better on ths exam. Also, I was not that good about keeping up with the material sometimes when I got busy with the project so there will be a lot more to review this time around. Other than that the semester is coming to an end and all grades are already in. The only thing left for the semester is the exam next week.  

### What will you do next week?

This next week I plan on going to lectures as per usual. There is one more day of presentations and then on Thursday we have the exam. For next week I plan on preparing for the exam on Thursday. I want to go through all the lectures and pracice coding the concepts gone over in class. Additionally, I plan on reviewing all the readings because last exam there were more questions than I was expecting from the readings. I also want to go through the quizzes so I can practice some questions. It would be really good practice to go through the quizzes since when I take it I don't do too well.   

### Class experience

Overall, I enjoy this class. I think Professor Fraij is an amazing teacher and makes the learning a lot more easier. I really liked working with my group too for the idb project. Everyone in my group was  extremely smart and very easy to work with. We have not had any disagreements yet and someone is always willing to help others when someone is stuck. This is a nice change from other group projects I have worked on in the past. I really liked working with this group and on this project Other than the group project, I also like the material of the class and it is going at a good pace I think. The projects were fun and not too difficult. I got to learn a lot from the projects. The exam was a lot harder than I expected. The quizzes were a little nerve wrecking especially cause they were timed and you could not go back to change your answers. I always ended up makng silly mistakes and missed points. Overall, I am really glad I got to take this class during my last semester at UT. I have learned some valuable skills that I will be able to apply in my job.
